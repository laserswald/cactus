_a scheme implementation with spines_

## installation

First of all, don't use this. It'll prick you often. 

Compilation is done with djb redo, a minimal implementation being built in:

    ./do

You can configure what built-in functions you want in cactus by editing `config.h` and recompiling.

## what is actually supported 

see `config.h`
